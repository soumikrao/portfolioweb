<mark class="blue"> Soumik Rao</mark> here, Welcome! At Mahindra University in Hyderabad, India, I am now pursuing a degree in <mark class="red">Electrical 
and Electronics Engineering. </mark><br><br>
The sophisticated world of technology has always captivated me. Everything in this universe, in my opinion, can 
be understood, investigated, and resolved through <mark class="orange">science</mark> and <mark class="green">technology</mark>. I'm extroverted, committed, and 
enthusiastic, which makes me an excellent fit for any assignment.
<br><br> My mantra is <mark class = "violet">"efficient and timely outcomes,"</mark> and I can claim that I am a patient team player and a <mark class="yellow">natural leader</mark>, giving me the flexibility to work in or 
lead a team in any situation. <br><br>
I have a strong sense of <mark class="dblue">ambition and goal-orientation</mark>, which drives me to push my boundaries and discover new 
things. <br><br>
In addition to applied technology, <mark class ="red">physics</mark> is another area of interest for me. I've always been interested in 
<mark class = "blue">quantum physics</mark> and the <mark class = "pink">intricacies of space-time</mark>. I read everything that happens in the realm of physics with 
great interest. <br> <br>
<mark class="green">Robotics</mark> is my major area of interest. The future may have human-like companions equipped with A.I. and other 
technology.Â So, my ambition is to create a business that would commercialise <mark class = "violet">humanoids</mark> and install them in 
every home. <br> <br>
<mark class="yellow">Dear Reader</mark>, we are what we make, thus I take inspiration from what my idol said:<br>
